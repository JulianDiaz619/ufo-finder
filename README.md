Searches are performed by providing filters as seen below.
You first type a filter of your choice. In this example, a certain date is being provided to the date label.
![](/first_filter.png)

This is an additional filter used to find the city.
![](/second_filter.png)

As you can see, it does a very good job at filtering given what filters you have provided.
