## Overview of Project
In this project, we used Javascript, CSS, and HTML to build a webpage.In this webpage, we contruct a table with data, as well as a functional filter that is used to filter the data depending on the input given (Date, City, State, Country, Shape).
![](/webpage.png)
## Results
Searches are performed by providing filters as seen below.
You first type a filter of your choice. In this example, a certain date is being provided to the date label.
![](/first_filter.png)

This is an additional filter used to find the city.
![](/second_filter.png)

As you can see, it does a very good job at filtering given what filters you have provided.


## Summary

To summarize, this webpage has the ability to search through the data inside of it. One drawback of this webpage is that there is a small amount of data. For further development, more data should be added to provide the user with a more full experience. This data appears biased for the US so more data from the rest of the world needs to be provided. In the future, the webpage could be beautified by utilizing CSS.
